# Collision-Assignment
A real time 3d techniques for games assignment, this was the second challenge of the module and the second large assignment after the hierarchy animation assignment, it came off the back of a collisions based practical. That served as the basis of the assignment, with ultimate goal of achieving robust collision detection of multiple moving spheres in the form of a broad and a narrow stage. The Shared project is a dependency of the Collision project that contains the code for my submission for the assignment.
